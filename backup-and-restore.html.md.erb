This section describes how to back up and restore the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) control plane.
PKS uses the Cloud Foundry [BOSH Backup and Restore](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/index.html) framework to back up and restore the PKS control plane.

The PKS control plane includes the following components:

* UAA MySQL database
* PKS API MySQL database

BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the PKS control plane components.
BBR does not back up cluster data or deployed applications.

BBR orchestrates triggering the backup or restore process on the PKS BOSH deployment,
and transfers the backup artifacts to and from the PKS BOSH deployment.

For more information about installing and using BBR, see the following topics:

* [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html)
* [Backing up the PKS Control Plane](bbr-backup.html)
* [Restoring the PKS Control Plane](bbr-restore.html).

* For information about troubleshooting BBR, see [BBR Logging](bbr-logging.html).
