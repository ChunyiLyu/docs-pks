This topic describes the prerequisites and resource requirements for installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To install PKS, you must deploy one of the following:

* Ops Manager v2.3.1 or later
* Ops Manager 2.4.x

You use Ops Manager to install and configure PKS. See the [PKS Release
Notes](./release-notes.html) to confirm that your Ops Manager version supports PKS.

You must also create service accounts for Kubernetes master and worker nodes
and create a load balancer to access the PKS API.

###<a id='ops-man'></a> Install and Configure Ops Manager

To install and configure Ops Manager, follow the procedures in the Ops Manager
documentation:
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple versions of Ops Manager support
each version of PKS. Choose an Ops Manager version that supports the PKS version
you intend to install and follow the procedures in the corresponding version of
the Ops Manager documentation.</p>

1. [Preparing GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#top)
1. [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/deploy-manual.html)
1. [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/config-manual.html)

###<a id='k8s-accounts'></a> Create Service Accounts for Kubernetes

After you install and configure Ops Manager, you must create service accounts
for Kubernetes master and worker node VMs in your PKS deployment. To create
the service accounts, follow the procedures in [Creating Service Accounts in GCP
for PKS](gcp-service-accounts.html).

###<a id='lb'></a> Create a Load Balancer for the PKS API

Before you install PKS, you must create an external TCP load balancer so that you
can access the PKS API from outside the network. This load balancer allows you to
run `pks` commands from your local workstation. You must create the load balancer
before you install PKS, and then complete the load balancer configuration after
you install PKS.

To create a load balancer in GCP, follow the procedures in [Creating a GCP Load
Balancer for the PKS API](./gcp-api-load-balancer.html).

##<a id='resources'></a> Resource Requirements

Installing PKS deploys the following two virtual machines (VMs):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Container Service</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>16 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Ops Manager</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>160 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each Kubernetes cluster provisioned through PKS deploys the VMs listed below. If you deploy more than one Kubernetes cluster, you must scale your allocated resources appropriately.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM Name</th>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>CPU Cores</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk</th>
    <th>Persistent Disk</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
    <td>5 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>worker</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
    <td>50 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>
