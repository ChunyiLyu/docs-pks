<li>Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into
the Ops Manager VM, and use BOSH CLI to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops
Manager VM. For more information, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).</li>

<li>After logging in to the BOSH Director, identify the name of your PKS
deployment by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT deployments`, where `MY-ENVIRONMENT`
is the alias you set in <a href="manage-deployments-bosh.html#alias">Set a BOSH
Environment Alias</a>.
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
  Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes
  a BOSH-generated hash.</li>

<li>Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms` to list the VMs in your PKS
deployment, where `MY-DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms</pre></li>

<li>From the output of the previous command, locate the PKS API VM name. The
PKS API VM name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a BOSH-generated
hash that is different from the hash in the deployment name. SSH into the PKS
API VM by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT -d MY-DEPLOYMENT ssh PKS-API-VM`, where
`PKS-API-VM` is your PKS API VM name. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
 -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
 ssh pivotal-container-service/000a1111-222b-3333-4cc5-de66f7a8899b</pre></li>
