title: Using Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)
owner: PKS

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to create and use network profiles for Kubernetes clusters
provisioned with Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

## <a id='about'></a> About Network Profiles

Network profiles enable you to specify NSX-T configuration parameters at the time of cluster creation.

For example, you can customize the size of the load balancer
that is deployed when a Kubernetes cluster is created using PKS.
See [Load Balancers in PKS Deployments on vSphere with NSXâ€‘T](about-lb.html#with-nsx-t) for more information.

## <a id='permissions'></a> Required Permissions

Only PKS administrators can create and delete network profiles. For more information, see:

* [Define a Network Profile](#define-profile)
* [Create a Network Profile](#create-profile)
* [Delete a Network Profile](#delete-profile)

Kubernetes managers can list existing network profiles, assign them to clusters, and view cluster details.
For more information, see:

* [List Network Profiles](#list-profiles)
* [Create a Cluster With a Network Profile](#create-cluster)
* [View Cluster Details](#view-details)

## <a id="define-profile"></a> Define a Network Profile

Before you can create a network profile,
you must define your network profile configuration in a JSON file as follows:

Parameter 		| Description
----------------|----------------------------
`name`	  		| User-defined name for the network profile
`description`   | User-defined description for the network profile
`parameters`    | One or more name-value pairs
`lb_size`	  	| Size of the load balancer deployed with the Kubernetes cluster:<br> `small`, `medium`, or `large`

For example:

```
{
 "name": "lb-profile-medium",
 "description": "Network profile for MEDIUM size NSX-T load balancer",
 "parameters": { 
 	"lb_size": "medium" 
 	}
}
```

To create a network profile, follow the instructions in [Create a Network Profile](#create-profile).

## <a id="cli-commands"></a> Create and Use Network Profiles

You can create and use network profiles through the PKS CLI.
The PKS CLI supports the following operations for network profiles:

* [Create a network profile](#create-profile)
* [Delete a network profile](#delete-profile)
* [List network profiles](#list-profiles)
* [Create a Cluster with a Network Profile](#create-cluster)
* [View Cluster Details](#view-details)

### <a id="create-profile"></a> Create a Network Profile

After you define your network profile as described in [Define a Network Profile](#define-profile),
run the following command:

```
pks create-network-profile PATH-TO-YOUR-NETWORK-PROFILE-CONFIGURATION
``` 
Where `PATH-TO-YOUR-NETWORK-PROFILE-CONFIGURATION` is the path to the JSON file
you created in [Define a Network Profile](#define-profile).

Only cluster administrators, `pks.clusters.admin`, can create network profiles.
If a cluster manager, `pks.clusters.manage`, is attempting to create a network profile,
the following error occurs:

```
You do not have enough privileges to perform this action. Please contact the PKS administrator.
```

### <a id="delete-profile"></a> Delete a Network Profile

To delete a network profile, run the following command:

```
pks delete-network-profile NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
```

Where `NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile you want to delete.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot delete a network profile that is in use.</p>

Only cluster administrators, `pks.clusters.admin`, can delete network profiles.
If a cluster manager, `pks.clusters.manage`, is attempting to delete a network profile,
the following error occurs:

```
You do not have enough privileges to perform this action. Please contact the PKS administrator.
```

### <a id="list-profiles"></a> List Network Profiles

To list your network profiles, run the following command:

```
pks network-profiles
```

### <a id="create-cluster"></a> Create a Cluster with a Network Profile

To create a PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster with a network profile, run the following command:

```
pks create-cluster CLUSTER-NAME --external-hostname HOSTNAME --plan PLAN-NAME --network-profile NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME
```

Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAME` is a unique name for your cluster.
* `HOSTNAME` is your external hostname used for accessing the Kubernetes API.
* `PLAN-NAME` is the name of the PKS plan you want to use for your cluster.
* `NETWORK-PROFILE-NAME` is the name of the network profile you want to use for your cluster.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The network profile must exist.</p>

### <a id="view-details"></a> View Cluster Details

To view detailed information about your cluster, run the following command:

```
pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME
```

Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of your cluster. See the example output of this command below:

```
Name:						k8s1
Plan Name:					Plan 1
UUID:						6125f251-1a2e-4903-9192-efc21b27ec20
Last Action:				CREATE
Last Action State:			succeeded
Last Action Description:	Instance provisioning completed
Kubernetes Master Host:		k8s1
Kubernetes Master Port:		8443
Worker Nodes: 				1
Kubernetes Master IP(s):	192.168.150.104
Network Profile Name:		lb-profile-medium
