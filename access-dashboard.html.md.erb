Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized apps to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot containerized apps, and manage the cluster and its resources. Dashboard also provides information about the state of Kubernetes resources in the cluster. You can use Dashboard to manage the cluster at scale, including initiating rolling updates, restarting pods, and deploying new apps. 

To access Dashboard, follow the steps in _Accessing the Dashboard UI_ in the [Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard)](https://v1-9.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) documentation.

You must have `kubectl` credentials to access Dashboard. Requiring these credentials prevents unauthorized admin access to the Kubernetes cluster through a browser.

## Accessing Dashboard

Follow the steps below to access Dashboard for a Kubernetes cluster.

1. Retrieve the `kubectl` credentials. 
As a PKS operator or developer, you may already have access to `kubectl` credentials. If you do not, follow the instructions in [Retrieve Cluster Credentials and Configuration](cluster-credentials.html).

1. After retrieving `kubectl` credentials, run `kubectl proxy` on a command line. Do not exit or close the terminal.

1. Dashboard is now available. In a web browser, browse to `http://localhost:8001/ui` to access Dashboard.
