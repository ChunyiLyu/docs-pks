title: Using Proxies with PKS
owner: PKS

PKS lets you proxy outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from:

- PKS API
- Ops Manager and BOSH
- Kubernetes cluster nodes

When you configure PKS for PROXY Support in Ops Manager, HTTP/S Proxy setting are applied to the API Instance. You are able to create a Kubernetes cluster such that the ODB-Proxy on the API instance VM is able to CRUD objects on the NSX-T Manager behind a proxy.

## <a id="v2-2"></a>PKS API Proxy

Configure a proxy for PKS API traffic. A PKS deployment w/ NSX-T where vCenter & the NSX-T manager are on a separate network/subnet from the PKS API instance, and there is an HTTP/S proxy between the two networks.

1. Log in to Ops Manager.

1. Select the PKS tile.

1. Select the PKS API pane.

1. Under HTTP/HTTPS proxy, select Enabled.

1. Under HTTP Proxy URL, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, https://pksapiproxy.com:1234.

1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password in either HTTP Proxy Credentials or HTTPS Proxy Credentials.

1. Under No Proxy, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.

	For the PKS API proxy, you must include the following in the `no_proxy` field: 

		`<Deployment-Network-Cidr>,<Node-Network-IP-Block-Cidr>,<Pod-Network-IP-Block-Cidr>`

## <a id="v2-3"></a>BOSH Proxy

Configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and BOSH. See [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).

## Kubernetes Clusters Proxy

Configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters. See the [Networking section](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-2/installing-nsx-t.html#networking) of PKS with NSX-T tile configuration.
