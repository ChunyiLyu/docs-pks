<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic explains how to upgrade the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) tile for environments using vSphere with NSX-T.

PKS v1.1.5 supports NSX-T 2.2 and vSphere 6.5 U2. For details, see the [VMware Product Interoperability Matrix](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php) for PKS in the VMware documentation.

If you use PKS with NSX-T, we recommend that you upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 and NSX-T 2.2 to take advantage of key features and important architectural changes.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade PKS on vSphere with NSX-T, workloads in your Kubernetes cluster are unavailable while the NSX Edge nodes run the upgrade. Configure NSX Edge for high availability using Active/Standby mode to avoid workload downtime. For more information, see the <a href="./nsxt-prepare-env.html#nsx-edge-ha">Configure NSX Edge for High Availability (HA)</a> section of <em>Preparing NSX-T Before Deploying PKS</em>.</p>

## <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

Before you begin upgrading the PKS tile, follow the steps below:

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.
1. Verify the health of your Kubernetes environment by following the steps below:
	1. To verify that all nodes are in a ready state, run `kubectl get nodes` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all pods are running, run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all the processes are in a running state, run `bosh -d DEPLOYMENT instances --ps` for each deployment, replacing `DEPLOYMENT` with the deployment name. Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a BOSH-generated hash.
1. Make sure there are no issues with vSphere by following the steps below:
  1. Verify that datastores have enough space.
  1. Verify that hosts have enough memory.
  1. Verify that there are no alarms.
  1. Verify that hosts are in a good state.
1. (Optional) Back up the environment using the procedures in the following topics:
  - <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Pivotal-Container-Service/1.1/vmware-pks-11/GUID-PKS11-backup-and-restore.html">Backup PKS</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-A0B3667C-FB7D-413F-816D-019BFAD81AC5.html">Backup NSX-T</a>
  - <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2149237">Backup vCenter</a>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose not to back up PKS, NSX-T, or vCenter, we recommend backing up the NSX-T and NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP) logs. For more information, see <a href="#logs">PKS Logs for NSX-T and NCP</a> below.</p>

## <a id="worker-nodes"></a>Increase the Kubernetes Worker Node VM Size

The default Kubernetes worker node VM size provides insufficient disk space for PKS v1.1.5 or later on vSphere with NSX-T.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not increase the size of the Kubernetes worker node VM before you upgrade, the VM can run out of ephemeral disk space and cause the upgrade to fail.</p>

Follow the steps below to increase the Kubernetes worker node VM size:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Click **Plan 1**.

1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select a VM type with a minimum disk size of 16&nbsp;GB.

1. (Optional) If you have additional plans configured, repeat this procedure for each plan.

## <a id="ca-cert"></a>Verify NSX-T Manager CA Certificate Settings

Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. Under **NSX Manager CA Cert**, choose one of the following options:
  * Confirm that you have a valid NSX-T Manager CA certificate.
  * Select **Disable SSL certificate verification**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot choose both options. If you provide an NSX Manager CA certificate and also disable SSL certificate verification, the PKS upgrade fails.</p>

## <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Changes to the PKS Tile

Return to the Installation Dashboard and do one of the following:

  * **Apply Changes**: Under **Pending Changes**, click **Apply Changes**.
  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-9.png" alt="Apply changes and upgrade">
  * **Review Pending Changes [BETA]**:
      1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
      1. Click **Pivotal Container Service**.
      1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="post-upgrade"></a>Post-Upgrade Tasks

Follow the steps below:

1. Verify the health of your Kubernetes environment by following the steps below:
	1. To verify that all nodes are in a ready state, run `kubectl get nodes` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all pods are running, run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all the processes are in a running state, run `bosh -d DEPLOYMENT instances --ps` for each deployment, replacing `DEPLOYMENT` with the deployment name. Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a BOSH-generated hash.

1. Verify NCP changes.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In PKS v1.1.5 and later, NCP runs as a BOSH host process.
  Each Kubernetes master node VM has one NCP process running.
  If your cluster has multiple master nodes, one NCP process is active while the others are on standby.
  For more information, see <a href="#arch-changes">Architectural Changes</a>.</p>
	1. `bosh ssh` into the master node VM and run `monit summary`. Verify that you see `Process: 'ncp'` is `running`.
  For more information about using `bosh ssh`, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI
](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh).
	1. To check if the NCP process on the master node is active or on standby, run `/var/vcap/jobs/ncp/bin/nsxcli -c get ncp-master status`.
	1. To restart the NCP process, run `monit restart ncp` followed by `monit summary`.

## <a id="nsx-t"></a>(Optional) Upgrade NSX-T

Upgrading to NSX-T from 2.1 to 2.2 is optional but strongly recommended.
Support for NSX-T 2.1 will be removed in a future PKS release.

Follow the steps below to upgrade NSX-T:

1. Log in to the NSX Manager UI and navigate to **System > Utilities > Upgrade**.

1. Click **Proceed to Upgrade** and follow the instructions. The NSX-T Upgrade
wizard walks you through the process of upgrading from NSX-T 2.1 to NSX-T 2.2.

For more information, see [Upgrading NSX-T](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.2/com.vmware.nsxt.upgrade.doc/GUID-E04242D7-EF09-4601-8906-3FA77FBB06BD.html) in the VMware documentation.

## <a id="vsphere"></a>(Optional) Upgrade vSphere

Upgrade vSphere from version 6.5 or 6.5 U1 to 6.5 U2.

For more information, see [Upgrading vSphere in an NSX Environment](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-for-vSphere/6.4/com.vmware.nsx.upgrade.doc/GUID-ED005943-AB33-4D8D-A642-97774276C539.html) in the VMware
documentation.

## <a id="arch-changes"></a>PKS with NSX-T Architectural Changes

PKS v1.1.5 includes architectural changes related to its integration with NSX-T
and NCP. PKS uses NCP to integrate with NSX-T. For more information about NCP,
see [Overview of NSX-T Container Plug-in](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.0/com.vmware.nsxt.ncp_kubernetes.doc/GUID-52A92986-0FDF-43A5-A7BB-C037889F7559.html) in the VMware documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to install or configure NCP. NCP is automatically installed and configured when you deploy PKS in an NSX-T environment.</p>

### <a id="nsxt-node"></a>NSX-T Node Agent and Kube Proxy

In PKS v1.1.4 and earlier, the NSX-T Node Agent and NSX-T Kube Proxy run as a
daemon set on each worker node. In PKS v1.1.5, both the NSX-T Node Agent and
the Kube Proxy run as BOSH-managed processes on each worker node.

### <a id="ncp"></a>NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP)

In PKS v1.1.4 and earlier, NCP runs as a Kubernetes pod on a single worker
node. With PKS v1.1.5, NCP runs as a BOSH-managed process on the Kubernetes
master node.

In PKS v1.1.5, if you deploy a multi-master cluster, the NCP process
runs on all master nodes but is active on only a single master. If the
NCP process on an active master is unresponsive, BOSH activates another NCP
process.

### <a id="logs"></a> PKS Logs for NSX-T and NCP

In PKS v1.1.4 and earlier, you access NSX-T and NCP logs using `kubectl` commands. In PKS v1.1.5, NSX-T and NCP are BOSH-managed processes, and you access the logs for these components using BOSH.

BOSH jobs related to NSX-T integration with NCP as a BOSH process:

<table class="nice">
  <tr>
    <th>Location</th>
    <th>BOSH Jobs</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">Master Node</td>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/ncp</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/pks-nsx-t-prepare-master-vm</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/pks-nsx-t-ncp</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="4">Worker Nodes</td>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/nsx-kube-proxy</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/openvswitch</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/nsx-cni</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>/var/vcap/sys/log/nsx-node-agent</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Run the BOSH command `bosh –d DEPLOYMENT logs` to collect these logs, replacing
`DEPLOYMENT` with the name of your PKS deployment.
For more information, see [Using Logs](https://bosh.io/docs/job-logs/) in the BOSH
documentation.

When you upgrade to PKS v1.1.5, the existing logs for NSX-T and NCP are
deleted. Before you upgrade, you may want to back these logs up. For example,
you may need to analyze these logs if you experience problems with your PKS
deployment before upgrading, or problems related to a failed upgrade.
