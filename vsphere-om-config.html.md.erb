This topic describes how to configure Ops Manager for VMware vSphere.

If you are installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS) to vSphere **without** NSX-T integration, before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all of the steps in [Deploying Ops Manager to vSphere](vsphere-om-deploy.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a>.</p>

## <a id="set-up"></a>Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider (IdP), an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider

1. Log in to your IdP console and download the IdP metadata XML. Optionally, if your IdP supports metadata URL, you can copy the metadata URL instead of the XML.

1. Copy the IdP metadata XML or URL to the Ops Manager **Use an Identity Provider** log in page.

    <%= image_tag("meta-om.png") %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The same IdP metadata URL or XML is applied for the BOSH Director. If you use a separate IdP for BOSH, copy the metadata XML or URL from that IdP and enter it into the BOSH IdP Metadata text box in the Ops Manager log in page.</p>

1. Enter your **Decryption passphrase**. Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

1. Your Ops Manager log in page appears. Enter your username and password. Click **Login**.

1. Download your SAML Service Provider metadata (SAML Relying Party metadata) by navigating to the following URLs:
    * <strong>5a.</strong> Ops Manager SAML service provider metadata: `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN:443/uaa/saml/metadata` 
    * <strong>5b.</strong> BOSH Director SAML service provider metadata: `https://BOSH-IP-ADDRESS:8443/saml/metadata`

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To retrieve your <code>BOSH-IP-ADDRESS</code>, navigate to the <strong>Ops Manager Director</strong> tile > <strong>Status</strong> tab. Record the <strong>Ops Manager Director</strong> IP address.</p>

1. Configure your IdP with your SAML Service Provider metadata. Import the Ops Manager SAML provider metadata from Step 5a above to your IdP.
If your IdP does not support importing, provide the values below.
    * **Single sign on** URL: `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN:443/uaa/saml/SSO/alias/OPS-MAN-FQDN`
    * **Audience URI** (SP Entity ID): `https://OP-MAN-FQDN:443/uaa`
    * **Name ID**: Email Address
    * SAML authentication requests are always signed 

1. Import the BOSH Director SAML provider metadata from Step 5b to your IdP. If the IdP does not support an import, provide the values below. 
    * **Single sign on** URL: `https://BOSH-IP:8443/saml/SSO/alias/BOSH-IP`
    * **Audience URI** (SP Entity ID): `https://BOSH-IP:8443`
    * **Name ID**: Email Address 
    * SAML authentication requests are always signed 

1. Return to the **Ops Manager Director** tile, and continue with the configuration steps below. 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder (default: `pcf_vms`) where Ops Manager places VMs.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder (default: `pcf_templates`) where Ops Manager places VMs.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder (default: `pcf_disk`) where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. You must not nest this folder.

1. If you are deploying to vSphere with NSX-T, select **NSX Networking - NSX-T**. For deploying on other IaaSes select **Standard vCenter Networking**.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the VM Folder, Template Folder, and Disk path Folder names.</p>

## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 3: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("vsphere/vsphere-director.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.
1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported system metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use PCF JMX Bridge for consuming them outside of the Firehose, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this duplicate data, leave the <strong>JMX Provider IP Address</strong> field blank.</p>

1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported system metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use the BOSH HM Forwarder for consuming them, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent duplicate data, leave the <strong>Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address</strong> field blank.</p>

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable Ops Manager Resurrector functionality.
1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must enable post-deploy scripts to install PKS.</p>
1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.
1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** if you want Ops Manager to retry failed BOSH operations up to five times.
1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve Ops Manager Director VMs after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes. 
1. Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.

    * **Password**: Enter the password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.
1. Select a **Blobstore Location** to either configure the blobstore as an internal server or an external endpoint. Because the internal server is unscalable and less secure, Pivotal recommends you configure an external blobstore.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After you deploy Ops Manager, you cannot change the blobstore location.</p>
  * **Internal**: Select this option to use an internal blobstore. Ops Manager creates a new VM for blob storage. No additional configuration is required.
  * **S3 Compatible Blobstore**: Select this option to use an external S3-compatible endpoint. Follow the procedures in [Sign up for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) and [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the AWS documentation. When you have created an S3 bucket, complete the following steps:
      1. **S3 Endpoint**: Navigate to the [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) topic in the AWS documentation. Locate the endpoint for your region in the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table and construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the `us-west-2` region, the URL you create would be https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field in Ops Manager.
      1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
      1. **Access Key** and **Secret Key**: Enter the keys you generated when creating your S3 bucket.
      1. Select **V2 Signature** or **V4 Signature**. If you select **V4 Signature**, enter your **Region**.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: AWS recommends using Signature Version 4. For more information about AWS S3 Signatures, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests</a> in the AWS documentation.</p>
  * **GCS Blobstore**: Select this option to use an external Google Cloud Storage (GCS) endpoint. To create a GCS bucket, you will need a GCS account. Follow the procedures in [Creating Storage Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the GCP documentation. Once you have created a GCS bucket, complete the following steps:
        1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of your GCS bucket.
        1. **Storage Class**: Select the storage class for your GCS bucket. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) in the GCP documentation.
        1. **Service Account Key**: Follow the steps in the [Create Service Accounts](gcp-prepare-env.html#service-account) section to download a JSON file with a private key, and then enter the contents of the JSON file into the field.
        
        <%= image_tag("gcp/blobstore.png") %>

1. By default, PCF deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.

    <%= image_tag("director-database.png") %>

1. (Optional) **Director Workers** sets the number of workers available to execute Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.
1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the Ops Manager Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
1. Leave the **Director Hostname** field blank.
1. Ensure the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox is not selected.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH DNS must be enabled in all PKS deployments. If PAS and PKS are running on the same instance of Ops Manager, you cannot use the opt-out feature of BOSH DNS for your PAS without breaking PKS. If you want to opt out of BOSH DNS in your PAS deployment, install the tile on a separate instance of Ops Manager. For more information about opting out of BOSH DNS, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015720428-Disabling-or-Opting-Out-of-BOSH-DNS-in-PCF">Disabling or Opting Out of BOSH DNS in PCF</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#bosh-dns">BOSH DNS Service Discovery (Beta) and Opt-Out Option</a> in the <em>Ops Manager v2.0 Release Notes</em>.</p>
1. (Optional) To set a custom banner that users see when logging in to the Director using SSH, enter text in the **Custom SSH Banner** field.
  <%= image_tag("disable-bosh-dns.png") %>
1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>

## <a id='create-az'></a>Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page
Ops Manager Availability Zones correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple Availability Zones allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the Availability Zones assigned to the application. At least three availability zones are recommended for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.
    
    <%= image_tag("create-az.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    * **(Optional)** Click **Add Cluster** to create another set of **Cluster** and **Resource Pool** fields. You can add multiple clusters. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For more information about using availability zones in vSphere, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understand-az.html">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a> in the PCF documentation.</p>
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Click **Add Network** and create the following networks:
  * `pks-infrastructure`: for Ops Manager, the BOSH Director, the PKS broker, and the PKS API. If you have a large deployment with multiple tiles, you can choose to deploy the PKS broker and PKS API to a separate network named `pks-main`. See the table below for more information.
  * `pks-services`: for creating the master and worker VMs for Kubernetes clusters. The CIDR should not conflict with the pod overlay network `10.200.0.0/16` or the reserved Kubernetes services CIDR of `10.100.200.0/24`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are deploying PKS with NSX-T integration, see the network configuration table in the <a href="installing-nsx-t.html#config-ops-man">Configure Ops Manager</a> section of <em>Installing and Configuring PKS with NSX-T Integration</em>.</p>
    Use the values from the following table as a guide when you create each network,
replacing the IP addresses with ranges that are available in your vSphere environment:
