<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to monitor Pivotal Container Service (PKS) deployments using sink resources.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Using sink resources for monitoring requires that you have set up a log processing solution capable 
of log ingress over TCP as described in [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424). 

In addition, you must configure sinks in PKS to send logs to that destination. 
For information on how to create and manage sinks in PKS, see [Creating Sink Resources](./create-sinks.html).

## <a id="distinguish"></a> Distinguishing Pod Logs and API Events in Sinks

Sinks and ClusterSinks include both pod logs as well as events from the Kubernetes API. 

These logs and events are combined in a shared format to provide operators with a 
robust set of filtering and monitoring options. 

Sink data has the following characteristics. All entries:

* Are timestamped.
* Contain the host ID of the BOSH-defined VM.
* Are annotated with a set of structured data, which includes the namespace, the object name or pod ID, and the container name. 

### <a id="log-format"></a> Sink Log Entry Format

All sink log entries use the following format:

```
APP-NAME/NAMESPACE/POD-ID/CONTAINER-NAME
```

Where:

  * `APP-NAME` is `pod.log` or `k8s.event`.
  * `NAMESPACE` is the namespace associated with the pod log or Kubernetes event.
  * `POD-ID` is the ID of the pod associated with the pod log or Kubernetes event.
  * `CONTAINER-NAME` is the deployment associated with the pod log or Kubernetes event.


### <a id="pod-logs"></a> Pod Log Example

Pod logs entries are distinguished by the string `pod.log` in the `APP-NAME` field. 

The following is a sample pod log entry:

<pre>
36 <14>1 2018-11-26T18:51:41.647825+00:00 vm-3ebfe45d-492d-4bfd-59c4-c45d91688c65 
pod.log/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-dhddj - - [kubernetes@47450 
app="logspewer" pod-template-hash="2614622458" namespace_name="rocky-raccoon" 
object_name="logspewer-6b58b6689d-dhddj" container_name="logspewer"] 
2018/11/26 18:51:41 Log Message 589910
</pre>

Where:

  * `vm-3ebfe45d-492d-4bfd-59c4-c45d91688c65` is the host ID of the BOSH VM.
  * `pod.log` is the `APP-NAME`.
  * `rocky-raccoon` is the `NAMESPACE`.
  * `logspewer-6b58b6689d-dhddj` is the `POD-ID`.


### <a id="k8s-api"></a> Kubernetes API Event Example

Kubernetes API Event entries are distinguished by the string `k8s.event` in the `APP-NAME` field. 

The following is an example Kubernetes API event log entry:

<pre>
Nov 14 16:01:49 vm-b409c60e-2517-47ac-7c5b-2cd302287c3a 
k8s.event/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9n: 
Successfully assigned rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9nq7 
to vm-38dfd896-bb21-43e4-67b0-9d2f339adaf1
</pre>

Where:

  * `vm-b409c60e-2517-47ac-7c5b-2cd302287c3a` the host ID of the BOSH VM.
  * `k8s.event` is the `APP-NAME`.
  * `rocky-raccoon` is the `NAMESPACE`.
  * `logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9n` is the `POD-ID`.

The following are additional example Kubernetes API event log entries:  

<pre>
Nov 14 16:01:49 vm-b409c60e-2517-47ac-7c5b-2cd302287c3a 
k8s.event/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-76x: 
Killing container with id docker://logspewer:Need to kill Pod 
</pre>

<pre>
Nov 14 16:01:50 vm-38dfd896-bb21-43e4-67b0-9d2f339adaf1 
k8s.event/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9n: 
Container image "oratos/logspewer:v0.1" already present on machine 
</pre>

<pre>
Nov 14 16:01:50 vm-38dfd896-bb21-43e4-67b0-9d2f339adaf1 
k8s.event/rocky-raccoon/logspewer-6b58b6689d-j9n: 
Created container
</pre>


## <a id="important-events"></a> Notable Kubernetes API Events

The following table lists Kubernetes API Events that can help assess any Kubernetes scheduling problems in PKS. 

<table>
  <tr>
	<th width="200px">Event</th>
	<th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><code>ImagePullBackOff</code></td>
  	<td>Image pull back offs occur when the Kubernetes API can not reach a registry to retrieve a container, or the container does not exist in the registry. The scheduler might be trying to access a registry that is not available on the network. For example, Docker Hub is blocked by a firewall. Other reasons could include the registry is experiencing an outage or a specified container has been deleted or was never uploaded.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><code>CrashLoopBackOff</code></td>
  	<td>Crash loop back offs imply that the container is not functioning as intended. There are several potential causes of crash loop back offs which depend on the related workload. To investigate further, examine the logs for that workload.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><code>ContainerCreated</code></td>
  	<td>Operators can monitor the creation of containers to keep track of platform usage at a high level. Teams can use this event to monitor the usage of their cluster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td><code>FailedScheduling</code></td>
  	<td>This event occurs when a container cannot be scheduled. For instance, this may occur due to lack of node resources.
  	</td>
  </tr>
</table>
