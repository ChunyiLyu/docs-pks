The Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and PKS runtime platforms are both deployed by Ops Manager using BOSH.
You can deploy both PAS and PKS using the same Ops Manager instance, but we recommend that you deploy installations of PAS and PKS to separate Ops Manager instances for security reasons.
For increased security, we recommend deploying each Ops Manager instance using a unique cloud provider account.

Separate installations of Ops Manager allow you to customize and troubleshoot runtime tiles independently.
You may choose to configure Ops Manager with different settings for your PAS and PKS deployments.
For example, PKS and many PAS features depend on BOSH DNS.

If you deploy PAS to a separate Ops Manager instance, you can disable BOSH DNS for troubleshooting purposes.
PAS can run without BOSH DNS, but key features such as secure service credentials with CredHub, service discovery for container-to-container networking, and NSX-T integration do not work when BOSH DNS is disabled.

If you deploy PAS and PKS to the same Ops Manager instance, you cannot disable BOSH DNS without breaking your PKS installation along with the PAS features that depend on BOSH DNS.
