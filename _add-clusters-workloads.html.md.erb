At this time, operators should add additional workloads and create an additional cluster to ensure that the PKS control plane is still functional. For more information on performing those actions, see <a href="maintain-uptime.html#upgrades">About Workload Upgrades</a> and <a href="create-cluster.html">Create a Cluster</a>. 

You can monitor the PKS control plane VM by clicking the <b>Pivotal Container Service tile</b>, selecting <b>Status</b> tab, and reviewing the **Pivotal Container Service** VM's data points. If any data points are at capacity, scale your deployment accordingly.
