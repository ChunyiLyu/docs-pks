<sup>&#42;</sup> Enter the load balancer name in the **Resource Config** tab to connect the load balancer to the PKS control plane. For more information, see the [Resource Config](installing-pks-aws.html#resource-config) section of _Installing PKS on AWS_.

<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> For more information about configuring Service `type:LoadBalancer` on AWS, see the [Access Workloads Using an Internal AWS Load Balancer](deploy-workloads.html#internal-lb) section of _Deploying and Accessing Basic Workloads_.

### <a id="v1.2.0-upgrade"></a>Upgrade Path

The supported upgrade paths to PKS v1.2.0 are from PKS v1.1.5 and later.

For customers who have deployed PKS v1.1.5 with NSX-T, NSX-T v2.2 is the version supported for upgrades to PKS v1.2.0.

For more information, see [Upgrading PKS](upgrade-pks.html) and [Upgrading PKS with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

### <a id="v1.2.0"></a>What's New

PKS v1.2.0 adds support for the following:

* Network profiles for per-cluster customization and choice of load balancer size for PKS deployments with NSX-T. For more information, see [Using Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)](network-profiles.html).
* Xenial stemcells.
* Multi-master clusters. For more information, see the *Plans* section of [Installing PKS](installing.html) for your IaaS.
* OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication strategy in Kubernetes. For more information, see the *Configure OpenID Connect* section of [Installing PKS](installing.html) for your IaaS.
    * Cluster administrators can use LDAP users and groups in `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects. For more information, see [Managing Users in PKS with UAA](manage-users.html).
* Namespace sinks. For more information, see [Creating Sink Resources](create-sinks.html).
* PKS can be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). For more information, see the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](aws-index.html) topic.
* You can specify the number of worker nodes to be installed in parallel. For more information, see the *PKS API* section of [Installing PKS](installing.html) for your IaaS.
* Metrics server is deployed by default. Heapster is still deployed but will be removed in a future release per Kubernetes deprecation notice.
* Support for Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
* Support for the HostPort feature to allow pods to open external ports on the worker node.
* ETCD release v3.3.9.
* Updated admission controllers based on Kubernetes recommendations, including `DefaultTolerationSeconds` and `ValidatingAdminssionWebhook`. `NamespaceExists` has been removed.
* Changed Docker storage driver from `overlay` to `overlay2`. The old images will remain on each worker in the `/var/vcap/data/docker/docker/overlay` directory.
* Support for the NTLM formatted usernames for vSphere.
* Improved drain script for large cluster upgrades.
* Deprecated support for NSX-T v2.1.
* Fix: vSphere credentials are not stored in the BOSH manifest.

### <a id="v1.2.0-known-issues"></a>Known Issues

* For PKS with NSX-T, using the **Generate RSA Certificate** option in the **Networking** section of the PKS tile for generating the **NSX Manager Super User Principal Identity Certificate** results in the following error during deployment of PKS:

    ```
    ERROR: NSX-T Precheck failed due to error code:
    403, error message: The credentials were incorrect
    or the account specified has been locked.
    ```
    <br>
    This error is the result of a change in the cURL version as part of the stemcell upgrade from Ubuntu v14.04 to v16.04. In Ubuntu 16.04, cURL comes with GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL. For a workaround, use the manual approach for generating the principle identity certificate and key as described in [Generating and Registering the NSX Manager Superuser Principal Identity Certificate and Key](generate-nsx-pi-cert.html).
* Namespace sinks do not work in environments without internet access.
* Due to a limitation with the NSX-T v2.2 scheduler component, VMware recommends that you do not use a medium-sized load balancer at this time, even if the NSX-T edge cluster has more than two edge node VMs. This limitation is addressed in NSX-T v2.3, which PKS v1.2.0 supports.
* When using AWS, you must select a VM type under **Master/ETCD VM Type**, **Worker VM Type**, and **Errand VM Type** in the **Plans** section of the PKS tile in order to save a plan on the tile. You cannot leave the VM type on **Automatic**. The recommended minimum VM type is `t2.medium`.
* Existing certificates will expire after a year. The certificates will be updated in a future release.
* The **External Groups Whitelist** field in the **UAA** section of the PKS tile has a 4000 character limit due to the size limitation of JWT tokens.
* In an internetless environment, the images for the kube-system components must be present within the environment to allow the `overlay2` upgrade.
* Kubernetes end users must manually configure their kubeconfig in order to use their LDAP credentials if OIDC is turned on.
* UAA refresh token for OIDC authorization is currently not supported.
* When creating a cluster with the `pks create-cluster` command, you cannot use the `\` character in the value for `--external-hostname`. For more information about creating clusters, see the [Create a Kubernetes Cluster
](create-cluster.html#create) section of <em>Creating Clusters</em>.
* When a cluster is created, the output logs will contain the following warning: `Warning: DNS address not available for the link provider instance: pivotal-container-service/[uuid]`. It has no effect on the cluster creation.
