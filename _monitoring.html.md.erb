You can monitor Kubernetes clusters and pods metrics externally using the integration with <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com">Wavefront by VMware</a>.<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before you configure the Wavefront integration, you must have an active Wavefront account and access to a Wavefront instance. You provide your Wavefront access token during configuration. For instructions and additional information, see the <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com">Wavefront documentation</a>.</p>

By default, monitoring is disabled. To enable and configure Wavefront monitoring, do the following:

1. Under **Wavefront Integration**, select **Yes**.<br>

1. Under **Wavefront URL**, enter the URL of your Wavefront subscription. For example, `https://try.wavefront.com/api`.
1. Under **Wavefront Access Token**, enter the API token for your Wavefront subscription.
1. To configure Wavefront to send alerts by email, enter email addresses or Wavefront Target IDs separated by commas under **Wavefront Alert Recipient**. For example: `user@example.com,Wavefront_TargetID`. To create alerts, you must enable errands.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must enable errands to create alerts. In the <strong>Errands</strong> tab, enable the <strong>Create pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand</strong> and <strong>Delete pre-defined Wavefront alerts errand</strong>.</p>
1. Click **Save**. Your settings apply to any clusters created after you have saved these configuration settings and clicked **Apply Changes**.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The PKS tile does not validate your Wavefront configuration settings. To verify your setup, look for cluster and pod metrics in Wavefront.</p>
