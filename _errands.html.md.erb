Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation.

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand. For a typical PKS deployment, we recommend that you leave the default settings.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. We recommend that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.

If you are upgrading PKS, you must enable the <strong>Upgrade All Clusters</strong> errand.</p>
