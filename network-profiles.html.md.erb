title: Create and Use Network Profiles (NSX-T Only)
owner: PKS

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes what network profiles are, how to create them, and how to use when deploying a Kubernetes cluster using PKS.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Network profiles are only available with NSX-T.</p>

## <a id='about-network-profiles'></a>About Network Profiles

Network profiles let you specify NSX-T configuration paramaters at cluster creation. 

For the initial release of network profiles you can customize the size the of the load balancer that is deployed when a Kubernetes cluster is created. Future releases of network profiles will provide additional NSX-T customizations at cluster creation time.
 
See [Load Balancers in PKS Deployments on vSphere with NSXâ€‘T](about-lb.html#with-nsx-t) for more information.

## <a id='about-network-profiles'></a>Network Profiles Permissions

The PKS administrator defines a network profile using a JSON configuration file and the PKS CLI command `create-network-profile`. The PKS administrator can also delete network profiles using the `pks delete-network-profile` command.  

The Kubernetes cluster administrator can list the available network profiles using the `pks network-profiles` command and make use of a network profile when creating a cluster using the `--network-profile` flag with the `pks create-cluster` command. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot delete a network profile that is in use.

## <a id="master-id"></a>Configuration File Format

You use JSON to define the network profile configuration. The configuration format requires the following three fields:

Parameter 		| Value   					 | Description
----------------|----------------------------|------------
`name`	  		| String  					 | User-defined name for the network profile.
`description`   | String    				 | User-defined description for the network profile.
`parameters`    | Array 					 | One or more name-value pairs.
`lb_size`	  	| `small`, `medium`, `large` | Customize the size of the load balancer deployed with the Kubernetes cluster.

For example:

```
{
 "name": "lb-profile-medium",
 "description": "Network profile for MEDIUM size NSX-T load balancer",
 "parameters": { 
 	"lb_size": "medium" 
 	}
}
```

## <a id="master-id"></a>Network Profile Commands

This section lists the commands available for creating, deleting, listing, and using network profiles.

### Create network profile

To create a network profile:

```
pks create-network-profile /path/to/network-profile.json
``` 

Success: `Network profile <name> successfully created`.

Error:
- `Can't open input file: failed to read input file <json configuration>`
- `Input file format error: failed to parse network profile JSON input: <error data>`
- `Network Profile parameter format error: failed to serialize network profile parameters: <error data>`
- `Not logged in: you must login first: <error data>`
- `You do not have enough privileges to perform this action. Please contact the PKS administrator.`

The last error occurs if a cluster manager (`pks.clusters.manage` privilege) is attempting to create a network-profile. Only a cluster administrator (`pks.clusters.admin` privilege) can create network-profiles.

### Delete network profile

To delete network profile:

```
pks delete-network-profile <name>`
```

Prompt: `Are you sure you want to delete the network profile <name>? (y/n):`
Success: `Deletion of <name> completed`

Error: 
- `Not logged in: you must login first: <error data>`
- `Profile is in use: The network profile <profile name> is still used by clusters.`
- `You do not have enough privileges to perform this action. Please contact the PKS administrator.`

The last error occurs if a cluster manager (`pks.clusters.manage` privilege) is attempting to delete a network-profile. Only a cluster administrator (`pks.clusters.admin` privilege) can delete network-profiles.

### List network profiles

To list network profiles that have been created:

```
pks network-profiles
```

Success: 	`Name` `Description`
			`Name` `Description`

Error: `Not logged in: you must login first: <error data>`

### Create Kubenetes Cluster with Network Profile

To create a Kubernetes cluster with a network profile:

```
pks create-cluster <cluster name> --external-hostname <hostname> --plan <plan name> --network-profile <network profile name>
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The network profile must exist.

### Get cluster created with Network Profile

The `pks cluster <cluster name>` command indicates if a cluster is created using a network profile:

```
Name:						k8s1
Plan Name:					Plan 1
UUID:						6125f251-1a2e-4903-9192-efc21b27ec20
Last Action:				CREATE
Last Action State:			succeeded
Last Action Description:	Instance provisioning completed
Kubernetes Master Host:		k8s1
Kubernetes Master Port:		8443
Worker Nodes: 				1
Kubernetes Master IP(s):	192.168.150.104
Network Profile Name:		lb-profile-medium
```
