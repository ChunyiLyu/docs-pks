To apply custom Kubernetes workloads to every cluster created on a plan, add a YAML file to the tile config under **Default Cluster Apps**.

Custom workloads define what a cluster includes out of the box.

For example, you can use custom workloads to configure metrics or logging.

The following example YAML file comes from the [Kubernetes documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes):

<pre class="terminal">
apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
    metadata:
      # unlike pod-nginx.yaml, the name is not included in the meta data as a unique name is
      # generated from the deployment name
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
</pre>
