Operators should add additional workloads and create an
additional cluster to ensure that the PKS control plane remains functional.
For more information about performing those actions, see
<a href="maintain-uptime.html#upgrades">About Workload Upgrades</a> and
<a href="create-cluster.html">Create a Cluster</a>.

You can monitor the PKS control plane VM by clicking the <strong>Pivotal Container Service tile</strong>, selecting <strong>Status</strong> tab, and reviewing the **Pivotal Container Service** VM's data points. If any data points are at capacity, scale your deployment accordingly.
