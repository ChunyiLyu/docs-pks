Perform the following steps:

1. Click **PKS API**.
1. Under **Certificate to secure the PKS API**, provide your own certificate and private key pair.

The certificate you enter here should cover the domain that routes to the PKS API VM with TLS termination on the ingress.<br><br>
    (Optional) If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can have Ops Manager generate one for you. Perform the following steps:
  1. Select the **Generate RSA Certificate** link.
  1. Enter the wildcard domain for your API hostname.
    For example, if your PKS API domain is `api.pks.example.com`, then enter `*.pks.example.com`.
  1. Click **Generate**.<br>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager requires a wildcard certificate. If you enter a FQDN when generating the certificate, the PKS installation fails.
    </p>
1. Under **API Hostname (FQDN)**, enter a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to access the PKS API. For example, `api.pks.example.com`. If you are deploying PKS on AWS, use the PKS API FQDN that Terraform has registered. Run `terraform output` and locate the value for the field `load_balancer_name`.
1. Under **Worker VM Max in Flight**, enter the maximum number of non-canary worker instances to create or resize in parallel within an availability zone.
	<br><br>
	This field sets the `max_in_flight` variable, which limits how many instances of a component can start simultaneously when a cluster is created or resized.
	The variable defaults to `1`, which means that only one component starts at a time.
1. Click **Save**.
