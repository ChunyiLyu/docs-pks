This topic describes the prerequisites and resource requirements for installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To install PKS, you must deploy Ops Manager v2.2.2 and later or v2.3.1 and later.
You use Ops Manager to install and configure PKS. See the [PKS Release
Notes](./release-notes.html) to confirm that your Ops Manager version supports PKS.

You must also create service accounts for Kubernetes master and worker nodes.

###<a id='ops-man'></a> Install and Configure Ops Manager

To install and configure Ops Manager, follow the procedures in the Ops Manager
documentation:
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple versions of Ops Manager support
each version of PKS. Choose an Ops Manager version that supports the PKS version
you intend to install and follow the procedures in the corresponding version of
the Ops Manager documentation.</p>

1. [Preparing GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#top)
1. [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/deploy-manual.html)
1. [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/config-manual.html)

###<a id='k8s-accounts'></a> Create Service Accounts for Kubernetes

After you install and configure Ops Manager, you must create service accounts
for Kubernetes master and worker node VMs in your PKS deployment. To create
the service accounts, follow the procedures in [Creating Service Accounts in GCP
for PKS](gcp-service-accounts.html).

##<a id='resources'></a> Resource Requirements

Installing PKS deploys the following virtual machines (VMs):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Container Service</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>16 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Ops Manager</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>160 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BOSH Director</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>16 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each Kubernetes cluster provisioned through PKS deploys the VMs listed below. If you deploy more than one Kubernetes cluster, you must scale your allocated resources appropriately.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM Name</th>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>CPU Cores</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk</th>
    <th>Persistent Disk</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
    <td>5 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>worker</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
    <td>50 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>
