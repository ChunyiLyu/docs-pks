This topic describes how to verify the health of your Pivotal Container Service
(PKS) deployment.

For the BOSH CLI commands in this topic, replace the text as follows:

* `MY-ENV`: the alias you set for your BOSH Director. For more information, see
[Managing PKS Deployments with BOSH](manage-deployments-bosh.html).
* `MY-DEPLOYMENT`: the name of your PKS deployment. PKS deployment names
begin with `pivotal-container-service` and include a unique BOSH-generated hash.
* `VM-NAME`: your Kubernetes master node VM name.
* `ID`: your Kubernetes master node VM ID. This is a unique BOSH-generated hash.

## <a id="k8s"></a>Verify Kubernetes Health

Verify the health of your Kubernetes environment by following the steps below:

1. To verify that all nodes are in a ready state, run the following command for all Kubernetes contexts:
  <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl get nodes</pre>

1. To verify that all pods are running, run the following command for all Kubernetes contexts:
  <pre class="terminal">$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces</pre>

1. To verify that all the processes are in a running state, run the following
command for each deployment:
  <pre>bosh -d MY-DEPLOYMENT instances --ps</pre>

## <a id="ncp"></a>Verify NCP Health (NSX-T Only)

In PKS v1.1.5 and later on vSphere with NSX-T, NCP runs as a BOSH host process.
Each Kubernetes master node VM has one NCP process running. If your cluster has
multiple master nodes, one NCP process is active while the others are on standby. For more information, see [Architectural Changes](release-notes.html#arch-changes).

Verify NCP health by following the steps below:

1. From the Ops Manager VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e MY-ENV login</pre>

1. To locate the Kubernetes master node VM name and ID, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms</pre>

1. To SSH into the Kubernetes master node VM, run the following command:
  <pre>bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT ssh VM-NAME/ID</pre>

1. From the master node VM, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ monit summary</pre>
  Verify that you see `Process: 'ncp'` is `running`.

1. To check if the NCP process is active or on standby, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ /var/vcap/jobs/ncp/bin/nsxcli -c get ncp-master status</pre>

1. To restart the NCP process, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ monit restart ncp</pre>

1. To verify that the NCP process restarts successfully, run the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ monit summary</pre>
