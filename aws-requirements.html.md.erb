This topic describes the prerequisites and resource requirements for installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you install PKS, you must install Ops Manager v2.2.2 and later or v2.3.1 and later.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Each version of PKS supports multiple versions of Ops Manager.
To confirm that PKS supports your Ops Manager version, see <a href="release-notes.html">PKS Release Notes</a>.</p>

To install an Ops Manager version that is compatible with the PKS version you intend to use,
follow the instructions in the corresponding version of the Ops Manager documentation.

If you want to install Ops Manager v2.2, follow the instructions below:

* [Preparing to Deploy PCF on AWS Using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-2/aws/prepare-env-terraform.html)
* [Configuring BOSH Director on AWS Using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-2/aws/config-terraform.html)

If you want to install Ops Manager v2.3, follow the instructions below:

* [Preparing to Deploy PCF on AWS Using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-3/aws/prepare-env-terraform.html)
* [Configuring BOSH Director on AWS Using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-3/aws/config-terraform.html)

##<a id='resources'></a> Resource Requirements

Installing PKS deploys the following two virtual machines (VMs):

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM</th>
    <th>CPU</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Container Service</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>16 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pivotal Ops Manager</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>8 GB</td>
    <td>160 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each Kubernetes cluster provisioned through PKS deploys the VMs listed below. If you deploy more than one Kubernetes cluster, you must scale your allocated resources appropriately.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>VM Name</th>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>CPU Cores</th>
    <th>RAM</th>
    <th>Ephemeral Disk</th>
    <th>Persistent Disk</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>master</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
    <td>5 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>worker</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4 GB</td>
    <td>32 GB</td>
    <td>50 GB</td>
  </tr>
</table>
