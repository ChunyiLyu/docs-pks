You can designate an external syslog endpoint for PKS component and cluster log messages.

To specify the destination for PKS log messages, do the following:

1. Click **Logging**.
1. To enable syslog forwarding, select **Yes**.

1. Under **Address**, enter the destination syslog endpoint.
1. Under **Port**, enter the destination syslog port.
1. Select a transport protocol for log forwarding.
1. (Optional) Pivotal strongly recommends that you enable TLS encryption when forwarding logs as they may contain sensitive information. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. To enable TLS, perform the following steps:
  1. Under **Permitter Peer**, provide the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer. For example, `*.YOUR-LOGGING-SYSTEM.com`.
  1. Under **TLS Certificate**, provide a TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to provide a new certificate if the TLS certificate for the destination syslog endpoint is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) in your BOSH certificate store.
