title: Using Proxies with PKS on NSX-T
owner: PKS
---

This topic describes how to use proxies with Pivotal Container Service (PKS) with NSX-T.

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

If your environment includes HTTP/HTTPS proxies, you can configure PKS with NSX-T to use these proxies so that PKS-deployed Kubernetes master and worker nodes access public Internet services and other internal services through a proxy.

In addition, PKS proxy settings apply to the PKS API instance. 
When a PKS operator creates a Kubernetes cluster, the PKS API instance VM behind a proxy is able to manage NSX-T objects on the standard network.

You can also proxy outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director so that all PKS components use the same proxy service.

The following diagram illustrates the network architecture:

To configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the Kubernetes cluster nodes and the PKS API server, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and log in.

1. Click the PKS tile.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**.

1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `https://myproxy.com:1234`.

1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the user name and password in either **HTTP Proxy Credentials** or **HTTPS Proxy Credentials**.

1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the comma-separated list of IP addresses that must bypass the proxy to allow for internal PKS communication. 
	<br><br>
	In addition to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, include your deployment network CIDR, your node network IP block, and your pod network IP block CIDR:

	```
	127.0.0.1,localhost,
	DEPLOYMENT-NETWORK-CIDR,
	NODE-NETWORK-IP-BLOCK-CIDR,
	POD-NETWORK-IP-BLOCK-CIDR
	```

## <a id='pks-om-bosh-proxy'></a>Enable Ops Manager and BOSH Proxy

To enable a proxy for outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from Ops Manager and the BOSH Director, perform the following steps: 

1. Navigate to Ops Manager and log in.

1. Select **User Name > Settings** in the upper right.

1. Click **Proxy Settings**.

	<img src="images/pks-proxy-config.png" alt="PKS Proxy Settings" width="325">

1. Under **HTTP Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTP proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.

1. Under **HTTPS Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `https://myproxy.com:1234`.

1. Under **No Proxy**, include the hosts that must bypass the proxy. This is required.
	<br><br>
	In addition to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, include the BOSH Director IP and the PKS VM IP. 
	The BOSH Director IP is typically the first IP address in the deployment network CIDR, 
	and the PKS VM IP is the second IP address in the deployment network CIDR.

	```
	127.0.0.1,localhost,BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP,PKS-VM-IP
	```

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager does not allow the use of a CIDR range in the <strong>No Proxy</strong> field. You must specify the individual IPs to bypass the proxy.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy Ops Manager and the BOSH Director with the updated proxy settings.
