title: Firewall Ports and Protocols Requirements for vSphere with NSX-T
owner: PKS

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the firewall ports and protocols requirements for using Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on vSphere with NSX-T integration.

In environments with strict inter-network access control policies, firewalls often require conduits to pass communication between system components on a different network or allow interfacing with external systems such as with enterprise applications or the public Internet. 

For PKS, the recommendation is to disable security policies that filter traffic between the networks supporting the system. When that is not an option, refer to the following table, which identifies the flows between system components in a typical PKS deployment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You have the option to expose containerized applications, running in a Kubernetes cluster, for external consumption through various ports and methods. You can enable external access to applications by way of Kubernetes NodePorts, load-balancers, and ingress. Enabling access to applications through Kubernetes load-balancers and ingress controller types allow for specific port and protocol designations, while NodePort offers the least control and dynamically allocates ports from a pre-defined range of ports.</p>
