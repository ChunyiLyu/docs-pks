This topic explains how to upgrade the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) tile and existing Kubernetes clusters. 
It also explains the service interruptions that can result from service changes and upgrades and from failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level.

For conceptual information about upgrading the PKS tile and PKS-provisioned Kubernetes clusters, see [What Happens During PKS Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not manually upgrade your Kubernetes version. The PKS service includes the compatible Kubernetes version.</p>

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

PKS v1.2 requires Ops Manager v2.2 or v2.3. If you use Ops Manager v2.1, you must upgrade Ops Manager to v2.2 before upgrading PKS to v1.2.

The supported upgrade paths to PKS v1.2 are from PKS v1.1.5 and later. If you use PKS v1.1.4 or earlier, you must upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 or later before upgrading to PKS v1.2.

## <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

Before you begin upgrading the PKS tile, consider your workload capacity and uptime requirements.
If workers are operating too close to their capacity, the PKS upgrade can fail.
View your workload resource usage in Dashboard.
For more information, see [Access the Dashboard](access-dashboard.html).

If your clusters are near capacity for your existing infrastructure, Pivotal recommends scaling up your clusters before you upgrade.
Scale up your cluster by running `pks-resize` or create a cluster using a larger plan. For more information, see [Scale Existing Clusters](scale-clusters.html).

To prevent workload downtime during a cluster upgrade, Pivotal recommends running your workload on at least three worker VMs, using multiple replicas of your workloads spread across those VMs. For more information, see [Maintain Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html).

## <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a> Step 1: Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.2 and PKS v1.1.5

If you use Ops Manager v2.1, you must upgrade Ops Manager to v2.2 before upgrading PKS to v1.2.

1. To upgrade to Ops Manager v2.2, follow the procedure
detailed in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

If you use PKS v1.1.4 or earlier, you must upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 or later before upgrading to PKS v1.2. For more information, see [Upgrade PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/upgrade-pks.html) in the PKS v1.1 documentation.

## <a id="upgrade-tile"></a> Step 2: Upgrade the PKS Tile

To upgrade PKS, you follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install
the tile for the first time.
Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **Pivotal Container Service**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Optional: To upgrade all PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters when you upgrade the PKS tile, follow the steps below:
  1. Click **Errands**.
  1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, set the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to **Default (On)**. The errand upgrades a single Kubernetes cluster at a time. Upgrading PKS Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service, as described in [Service Interruptions](#interruptions) below.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you upgrade PKS from v1.1 to v1.2, you must enable <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. This ensures existing clusters can perform resize or delete actions after the upgrade.</p>
  (Optional) To monitor the **Upgrade all clusters errand** using the BOSH CLI, do the following:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your PKS deployment. For more information, see [Manage PKS Deployments with BOSH](manage-deployments-bosh.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.
  1. Click **Save**.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you set the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>, your Kubernetes cluster version will fall behind the PKS tile version. If your clusters fall more than one version behind the tile, you can no longer upgrade the clusters. You must upgrade your clusters to match the PKS tile version before the next tile upgrade.</p>

1. Review the other configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes. For example, if you use NSX-T, follow the instructions in [Upgrade NSX-T](#upgrade-nsxt) before clicking **Apply Changes** for the PKS tile upgrade.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade PKS, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the PKS tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>

1. Return to the Installation Dashboard and do one of the following:
  * **Apply Changes**: Click **Apply Changes**.
  * **Review Pending Changes [BETA]**:
      1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
      1. Click **Pivotal Container Service**. If you changed **Post-Deploy Errands**, confirm that the **Post-Deploy Errands** setting matches the configuration you set in the previous step.
      1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

## <a id="upgrade-nsxt"></a>Step 3: Upgrade NSX-T (Optional)

If you are deploying PKS on vSphere with NSX-T integration, you must use NSX-T v2.2.

To upgrade PKS with NSX-T, make the following configuration changes:

1. Create the **NSX Manager Super User Principal Identity Certificate** by following the procedure in [Generating and Registering Certificates](generate-certificates.html) in _Installing PKS on vSphere with NSX-T Integration_.

1. Select the NAT option if Network Address Translation needs to be enforced for the Kubernetes nodes. Clearing this option allows the nodes to have globally routable IP addresses. For more information, see [NAT Topology](nsxt-topologies.html#topology-nat).

1. PKS allows you to specify dedicated IP blocks for node and pod networking.
Create these IP blocks according to the instructions in [Plan IP Blocks](nsxt-prepare-env.html#plan-ip-blocks).
Enter one or more domain servers used by Kubernetes nodes.
These domain servers will be used by the nodes that are created on the Node Networks that are dynamically generated at the time of cluster creation.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When upgrading NSX-T for PKS, you must use a different CIDR range for the node IP block than the one you used for the service network.</p>

1. (Optional) To configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters, do the following:
    * Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**.
    * Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.
    * (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password in either **HTTP Proxy Credentials** or **HTTPS Proxy Credentials**.
    * Under **No Proxy**, enter the service network CIDR where your PKS cluster is deployed. List any additional IP addresses that should bypass the proxy.

1. Make sure that the **Enable outbound internet access** checkbox is not selected. This setting is not applicable to vSphere without NSX-T integrations.

## <a id="upgrade-vcenter"></a>Step 4: Upgrade vCenter (Optional)

1. If you are deploying PKS on vSphere, consult [vSphere Version Requirements
](vsphere-requirements.html#vsphere) and upgrade vSphere if necessary.

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>


## <a id="upgrade-instances"></a>Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters

If you set the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to **Default (On)**, your PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters are upgraded automatically when the PKS tile upgrade runs.

If you set the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to **Off**, you can upgrade all PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters by setting the **Upgrade all clusters errand** to **On** and clicking **Apply Changes**.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: If you upgrade PKS from v1.1 to v1.2, you must enable <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. This ensures existing clusters can perform resize or delete actions after the upgrade.</p>
 
## <a id="interruptions"></a>Service Interruptions

Service changes and upgrades and failures at the process, VM, and IaaS level can cause outages in the PKS service, as described below.

Read this section if:

+ You are experiencing a service interruption and are wondering why.
+ You are planning to update or change a Kubernetes cluster and want to know if it might cause a service interruption.

### <a id='service-update'></a>Stemcell or Service Upgrade

An operator updates a stemcell version or the PKS tile version.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> The PKS API experiences downtime while the new stemcell is applied to the Pivotal Container Service VM. 
  - <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the update deploys successfully, apps reconnect automatically.

- <strong>Impact:</strong> Workloads running on single node clusters experience downtime.
  - <strong>Required Actions:</strong> None. If the update deploys successfully, workloads resume automatically. For more information, see [Maintain Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html#upgrades).
