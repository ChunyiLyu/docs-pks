<li>Gather credential and IP address information for your BOSH Director, SSH into
the Ops Manager VM, and use BOSH CLI to log in to the BOSH Director from the Ops
Manager VM. For more information, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH
CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).</li>

<li>Identify the name of your PKS deployment by running `bosh -e ENVIRONMENT
deployments`, where `ENVIRONMENT` is the alias you set in
<a href="manage-deployments-bosh.html#alias"> Set a BOSH Environment Alias</a>.
<br><br>For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks deployments</pre>
  Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes
  a BOSH-generated hash.</li>

<li>Identify the name of your PKS VM by running `bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT vms`,
  where `DEPLOYMENT` is your PKS deployment name.<br><br>For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 vms</pre>
  Your PKS VM name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a
  BOSH-generated hash. This value is different from the hash in your PKS
  deployment name.</li>

<li>SSH into the PKS VM by running `bosh -e ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT ssh PKS-VM`,
where `PKS-VM` is your PKS VM name.<br><br>For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e pks \
 -d pivotal-container-service/a1b2c333d444e5f66a77 \
 ssh pivotal-container-service/000a1111-222b-3333-4cc5-de66f7a8899b</pre></li>
