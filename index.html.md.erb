Pivotal Container Service (PKS) enables operators to provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters using BOSH and Pivotal Ops Manager.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

PKS uses the [On-Demand Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/index.html) to deploy [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://docs-kubo.cfapps.io/), a BOSH release that offers a uniform way to instantiate, deploy, and manage highly available Kubernetes clusters on a cloud platform using BOSH.

After operators install the PKS tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, developers can provision Kubernetes clusters using the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI), and run container-based workloads on the clusters with the Kubernetes CLI, [kubectl](installing-kubectl-cli.html).

PKS is available as part of [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io) or as a stand-alone product.

## <a id='features'></a>Features

PKS has the following features:

* **Kubernetes Compatibility**: Constant compatibility with current stable release of Kubernetes

* **Production-ready**: Highly available from applications to infrastructure, with no single points of failure

* **BOSH advantages**: Built-in health checks, scaling, auto-healing and rolling upgrades

* **Fully automated operations**: Fully automated deploy, scale, patch, and upgrade experience

* **Multi-cloud**: Consistent operational experience across multiple clouds

* **GCP APIs access**: The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Broker gives applications access to the Google Cloud APIs, and Google Container Engine (GKE) consistency enables the transfer of workloads from or to GCP

On vSphere, PKS supports deploying and running Kubernetes clusters in air-gapped environments.

##<a id='components'></a> PKS Components

The PKS control plane contains the following components:

* An [On-Demand Broker](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/) that deploys [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://docs-kubo.cfapps.io) (CFCR), an open-source project that provides a solution for deploying and managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) clusters using [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs).
* A Service Adapter
* The PKS API

For more information about the PKS control plane, see [PKS Cluster Management](control-plane.html).

For a detailed list of components and supported versions by a particular PKS release, see the [PKS Release Notes](release-notes.html).

For information about the requirements for installing PKS, see [PKS Prerequisites](prerequisites.html).

##<a id='preparing'></a> Preparing to Install PKS

To install PKS, you must deploy Ops Manager v2.1.
You use Ops Manager to install and configure PKS.

If you are installing PKS to vSphere, you can also configure integration with NSX-T and Harbor.

Consult the following table for compatibility information:

<table>
<tr>
<th>IaaS</th>
