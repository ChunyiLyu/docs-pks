<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic explains how to upgrade the Pivotal Container Service (PKS) tile for environments using vSphere with NSX-T.

PKS v1.1.5 supports NSX-T 2.2 and vSphere 6.5 U2. For details, see the [VMware Product Interoperability Matrix](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php) for PKS in the VMware documentation.

We recommend that you upgrade to PKS v1.1.5 and NSX-T 2.2 to take advantage of key features and important architectural changes.
For more information, see [NSX-T Architectural Changes](release-notes.html#arch-changes) in the PKS v1.1.5 release notes.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade PKS on vSphere with NSX-T, workloads in your Kubernetes cluster are unavailable while the NSX Edge nodes run the upgrade. Configure NSX Edge for high availability using Active/Standby mode to avoid workload downtime. For more information, see the <a href="./nsxt-prepare-env.html#nsx-edge-ha">Configure NSX Edge for High Availability (HA)</a> section of <em>Preparing NSX-T Before Deploying PKS</em>.</p>

## <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

Before you begin upgrading the PKS tile, follow the steps below:

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.
1. Verify the health of your Kubernetes environment by following the steps below:
	1. To verify that all nodes are in a ready state, run `kubectl get nodes` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all pods are running, run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all the processes are in a running state, run `bosh -d MY-DEPLOYMENT instances --ps` for each deployment, replacing `MY-DEPLOYMENT` with the deployment name. Your PKS deployment name begins with `pivotal-container-service` and includes a BOSH-generated hash.
1. Make sure there are no issues with vSphere by following the steps below:
  1. Verify that datastores have enough space.
  1. Verify that hosts have enough memory.
  1. Verify that there are no alarms.
  1. Verify that hosts are in a good state.
1. (Optional) Back up the environment using the procedures in the following topics:
  - <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Pivotal-Container-Service/1.1/vmware-pks-11/GUID-PKS11-backup-and-restore.html">Backup PKS</a>
  - <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/com.vmware.nsxt.admin.doc/GUID-A0B3667C-FB7D-413F-816D-019BFAD81AC5.html">Backup NSX-T</a>
  - <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2149237">Backup vCenter</a>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you choose not to back up PKS, NSX-T, or vCenter, we recommend backing up the NSX-T and NSX-T Container Plugin (NCP) logs. For more information, see <a href="#logs">PKS Logs for NSX-T and NCP</a> below.</p>

## <a id="upgrade"></a>Upgrade the PKS Tile

To upgrade PKS, you follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install
the tile for the first time.
Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

## <a id="worker-nodes"></a>Increase the Kubernetes Worker Node VM Size

The default Kubernetes worker node VM size provides insufficient disk space for PKS v1.1.5 or later on vSphere with NSX-T.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not increase the size of the Kubernetes worker node VM before you upgrade, the VM can run out of ephemeral disk space and cause the upgrade to fail.</p>

Follow the steps below to increase the Kubernetes worker node VM size:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Click **Plan 1**.

1. Under **Worker VM Type**, select a VM type with a minimum disk size of 16&nbsp;GB.

1. (Optional) If you have additional plans configured, repeat this procedure for each plan.

## <a id="ca-cert"></a>Verify NSX-T Manager CA Certificate Settings

Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile.

1. Click **Networking**.

1. Under **NSX Manager CA Cert**, choose one of the following options:
  * Confirm that you have a valid NSX-T Manager CA certificate.
  * Select **Disable SSL certificate verification**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot choose both options. If you provide an NSX Manager CA certificate and also disable SSL certificate verification, the PKS upgrade fails.</p>

## <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Changes to the PKS Tile

Return to the Installation Dashboard and do one of the following:

  * **Apply Changes**: Under **Pending Changes**, click **Apply Changes**.
  <img src="images/upgrade-nsxt-9.png" alt="Apply changes and upgrade">
  * **Review Pending Changes [BETA]**:
      1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
      1. Click **Pivotal Container Service**.
      1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="post-upgrade"></a>Verify the Upgrade

After you apply changes to the PKS tile and the upgrade is complete,
verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy and confirm that NCP is
running on the master node VM.

For the BOSH CLI commands in this section, replace the text as follows:

* `MY-ENV`: the alias you set for your BOSH Director. For more information, see
[Manage PKS Deployments with BOSH](manage-deployments-bosh.html).
* `MY-DEPLOYMENT`: the name of your PKS deployment. PKS deployment names
begin with `pivotal-container-service` and include a unique BOSH-generated hash.
* `VM-NAME`: your Kubernetes master node VM name.
* `ID`: your Kubernetes master node VM ID. This is a unique BOSH-generated hash.

### <a id="k8s-env"></a>Verify Kubernetes Environment Health

Verify the health of your Kubernetes environment by following the steps below:

  1. To verify that all nodes are in a ready state, run `kubectl get nodes` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all pods are running, run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` for all Kubernetes contexts.
  1. To verify that all the processes are in a running state, run `bosh -d MY-DEPLOYMENT instances --ps` for each deployment.

### <a id="ncp-verify"></a>Verify NCP Changes

In PKS v1.1.5 and later, NCP runs as a BOSH host process. Each Kubernetes master
node VM has one NCP process running. If your cluster has multiple master nodes,
one NCP process is active while the others are on standby. For more information,
see <a href="release-notes.html#arch-changes">NSX-T Architectural Changes</a>
in the PKS v1.1.5 release notes.

Verify the NCP changes by following the steps below:

  1. From the Ops Manager VM, run `bosh -e MY-ENV log-in`.
  1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT vms`.
  1. In the output of the previous command, find the Kubernetes master node VM name and ID.
  1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENV -d MY-DEPLOYMENT ssh VM-NAME/ID`.
  1. On the master node VM, run `monit summary`. Verify that you see `Process: 'ncp'` is `running`.
  1. To check if the NCP process is active or on standby, run `/var/vcap/jobs/ncp/bin/nsxcli -c get ncp-master status`.
  1. To restart the NCP process, run `monit restart ncp`.
  1. To verify that the NCP process restarts successfully, run `monit summary`.

## <a id="nsx-t"></a>(Optional) Upgrade NSX-T

Upgrading to NSX-T from 2.1 to 2.2 is optional but strongly recommended.
Support for NSX-T 2.1 will be removed in a future PKS release.

Follow the steps below to upgrade NSX-T:

1. Log in to the NSX Manager UI and navigate to **System > Utilities > Upgrade**.

1. Click **Proceed to Upgrade** and follow the instructions. The NSX-T Upgrade
wizard walks you through the process of upgrading from NSX-T 2.1 to NSX-T 2.2.
