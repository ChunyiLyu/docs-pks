title: Using Proxies with PKS
owner: PKS
---

If your environment includes HTTP/S proxies, you can configure PKS with NSX-T to use these proxies so that PKS-deployed Kubernetes master and worker nodes access public Internet services and other internal services through a proxy.

In addition, PKS proxy settings apply to the PKS API instance. When a PKS operator creates a Kubernetes cluster, the PKS API instance VM behind a proxy is able to manage NSX-T objects on the standard network.

You can also proxy outgoing HTTP/S traffic from Ops Manager and BOSH Director so that all PKS components use the same proxy service.

To configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from Kubernetes cluster nodes and the PKS API server:

1. In the PKS tile select the [Networking - NSX-T](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-2/installing-nsx-t.html#networking) pane.

1. Under **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**, select **Enabled**.

1. Under **HTTP Proxy URL**, enter the URL of your HTTP/HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `https://myproxy.com:1234`.

1. (Optional) If your proxy uses basic authentication, enter the username and password in either **HTTP Proxy Credentials** or **HTTPS Proxy Credentials**.

1. Under **No Proxy**, enter the following IP addresses that must bypass the proxy to allow for internal PKS communication:

	`127.0.0.1,localhost,<Deployment-Network-CIDR>,<Node-Network-IP-Block-CIDR>,<Pod-Network-IP-Block-CIDR>`

## <a id='pks-om-bosh-proxy'></a>Enable Ops Manager and BOSH Proxy

To enable a proxy for outgoing HTTP/S traffic from Ops Manager and BOSH:

1. Log in to Ops Manager.

1. Select User Name > **Settings** in the upper right.

1. Select **Proxy Settings**.

1. Under **HTTP Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTP proxy endpoint. For example, `http://myproxy.com:1234`.

1. Under **HTTPS Proxy**, enter the FQDN or IP address of the HTTPS proxy endpoint. For example, `https://myproxy.com:1234`.

1. Under **No Proxy**, include the following hosts that must bypass the proxy (required). Typically the BOSH Director IP is the first IP in the deployment network CIDR, and the 
PKS VM IP is the second IP in the deployment network CIDR.

		`127.0.0.1,localhost,<bosh-director-ip>,<pks-vm-ip>`

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager does not allow the use of a CIDR range in the **No Proxy** field. You must specify the individual IPs to bypass the proxy.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Installation Dashboard and click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy Ops Manager and BOSH Director with the updated proxy settings.
